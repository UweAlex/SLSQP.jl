# Strategic Paper 5.0

## SLSQP.jl – Reproduction as Foundation, Product Line as Structure

### 1. Mission

Development of a pure Julia implementation of SLSQP that:

* is functionally and numerically **equivalent** to NLopt/SciPy-SLSQP.
* operates without C/Fortran wrappers.
* is robust and reproducible.
* integrates seamlessly into the existing Julia optimization ecosystem.

**SLSQP is the primary end product.**
Independent, stand-alone end products are intentionally created along the way.
Modernization occurs only after equivalence is secured.

### 2. Strategic Guiding Principles

#### 2.1 The Equivalence Axiom

Phases 0–3 serve exclusively for algorithmic reproduction.
Equivalence means:

* Comparable iteration paths.
* Comparable convergence rates.
* Comparable termination conditions.
* Comparable robustness with degenerate problems.

**NLopt/SciPy serve as the reference anchors.**
Any significant deviation is an investigation case—not a feature.

#### 2.2 Modern Implementation ≠ Modern Algorithmics

**Allowed:** Multiple Dispatch, type parameters, in-place APIs, clear workspace structures, idiomatic Julia design.
**Not allowed before Phase 4:** Alternative QP backends, different merit functions, altered damping strategies, algorithmic "improvements."

**The mathematics remains unchanged. Only the implementation is modern.**

#### 2.3 Purpose-Built Product Line

SLSQP is the goal. Intermediate products are intentionally crafted, independent tools.
**Potential Product Structure:**

1. **NNLS-Core**
2. **QP-Transformation-Toolkit**
3. **KKT-Diagnostics-Utilities**
4. **SLSQP-Integration**

Each intermediate product must be independently usable, have a clear API, be documented, and be maintainable. **No "waste-product" releases.**

#### 2.4 Ecosystem Integration, Not a Parallel World

SLSQP.jl shall be compatible with `Optimization.jl`, satisfy `SciMLBase` interfaces, utilize existing data structures, and not enforce proprietary problem formats.
**The goal is interchangeability, not secession.**

### 3. Phased Roadmap

#### Phase 0 – Reference Forensics

**Goal:** Secure exact algorithmic specification.
**Analysis of:** Original Kraft-Fortran, NLopt C-implementation, SciPy port.
**Documentation of:** Numerical constants, rank tolerances, termination criteria, damping factors, merit parameters, active-set logic.
**Output:** Technical Reference Document.

#### Phase 1 – NNLS as the First End Product

**Goal:** Stable Lawson-Hanson reproduction.
**Features:** QR-based solution, anti-cycling rules, defined tolerances, deterministic behavior, in-place & out-of-place API.
**Restrictions:** No sparse support, no AD integration, no parallelization.
**Release Criterion:** Independently robust and usable.

#### Phase 2 – QP-Subproblem Reproduction

**Goal:** Exact QP → LDP → NNLS transformation as per the reference SLSQP.
**Includes:** Linearized constraints, Hessian + gradient construction, Householder/Cholesky steps, primal recovery.
**Validation:** Comparison with NLopt results.
**Optional Intermediate:** QP-Toolkit (if clearly independent).

#### Phase 3 – Complete SQP Loop

**Goal:** Algorithmically complete SLSQP.
**Includes:** BFGS update, merit function, line-search according to reference, active-set management, termination logic.
**Test Basis:** Hock-Schittkowski, degenerate constraints, ill-conditioned cases.
**Checkpoint:** Numerical equivalence achieved. Only here is SLSQP officially "reproduced."

#### Phase 4 – Integration

Integration of SciMLBase interface, `Optimization.jl` compatibility, documentation, benchmarks, and real-world problem examples. **No algorithmic intervention.**

#### Phase 5 – Targeted Modernization (Optional)

Only after secured reproduction:

* Improved AD support.
* Alternative QP backends.
* Performance tuning.
* Sparse matrix experiments.
* Diagnostic extensions.
**Modernization is kept separate and versioned.**

### 4. The "Not-To-Do" List (Protective Wall until Phase 3)

Until Phase 3 is completed, the following are **prohibited**:

* No AD dispatch in the core.
* No sparse matrix support.
* No multi-threading within the solver.
* No alternative line-search strategies.
* No alternative QP backends.
* No algorithmic "improvements."
* No SHGO-specific special paths.

**Only implementation improvements are allowed—no algorithmic changes.**

---

### 5. Risk Management

* **R1 – Architectural Euphoria:** Core first, modularization second.
* **R2 – Numerical Divergences:** Reference comparison at the iteration level.
* **R3 – Scope Explosion:** Feature freeze until Phase 3 is completed.
* **R4 – Maintenance Overload:** Intermediate products are only released if independently viable.

---

### 6. Success Criteria

The project is successful if:

1. A pure Julia SLSQP exists.
2. It corresponds numerically to NLopt/SciPy.
3. It is integrable into `Optimization.jl`.
4. At least one intermediate product is independently usable.
5. Modernization occurs consciously and controlled.

---

### 7. Strategic Essence

This project follows a clear order:
**Reproduction → Stabilization → Integration → Modularization → Modernization**

SLSQP is the end product. Intermediate products are intentionally crafted building blocks. Innovation begins only after secured equivalence.

**Next Step Proposal:**
Shall we proceed with **Phase 0**? I can provide a list of the critical numerical constants and tolerances used in the NLopt/Kraft implementations that must be matched exactly to ensure Phase 3 success. Which specific reference (NLopt-C or the original Fortran) would you like to prioritize for the initial forensic audit?
