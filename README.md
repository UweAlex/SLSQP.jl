# Strategic Paper 

## SLSQP.jl – Reproduction as Foundation, Product Line as Structure

### 1. Mission

Development of a pure Julia implementation of SLSQP that:

* is functionally and numerically **equivalent** to NLopt/SciPy-SLSQP.
* operates without C/Fortran wrappers.
* is robust and reproducible.
* integrates seamlessly into the existing Julia optimization ecosystem.

**SLSQP is the primary end product.**
Independent, stand-alone end products are intentionally created along the way.
Modernization occurs only after equivalence is secured.

---

### 2. Strategic Guiding Principles

#### 2.1 The Equivalence Axiom

Phases 0–3 serve exclusively for algorithmic reproduction.
Equivalence means:

* Comparable iteration paths.
* Comparable convergence rates.
* Comparable termination conditions.
* Comparable robustness with degenerate problems.

**NLopt/SciPy serve as the reference anchors.**
Any significant deviation is an investigation case—not a feature.

#### 2.2 Modern Implementation ≠ Modern Algorithmics

**Allowed:** Multiple Dispatch, type parameters, in-place APIs, clear workspace structures, idiomatic Julia design.
**Not allowed before Phase 4:** Alternative QP backends, different merit functions, altered damping strategies, algorithmic "improvements."

**The mathematics remains unchanged. Only the implementation is modern.**

#### 2.3 Purpose-Built Product Line

SLSQP is the goal. Intermediate products are intentionally crafted, independent tools.
**Potential Product Structure:**

1. **NNLS-Core**
2. **QP-Transformation-Toolkit**
3. **KKT-Diagnostics-Utilities**
4. **SLSQP-Integration**

Each intermediate product must be independently usable, have a clear API, be documented, and be maintainable. **No "waste-product" releases.**

#### 2.4 Ecosystem Integration, Not a Parallel World

SLSQP.jl shall be compatible with `Optimization.jl`, satisfy `SciMLBase` interfaces, utilize existing data structures, and not enforce proprietary problem formats.
**The goal is interchangeability, not secession.**

---

### 3. Phased Roadmap

#### Phase 0 – Reference Forensics

**Goal:** Secure exact algorithmic specification.
**Analysis of:** Original Kraft-Fortran, NLopt C-implementation, SciPy port.
**Documentation of:** Numerical constants, rank tolerances, termination criteria, damping factors, merit parameters, active-set logic.
**Output:** Technical Reference Document.

#### Phase 1 – NNLS as the First End Product

**Goal:** Stable Lawson-Hanson reproduction.
**Features:** QR-based solution, anti-cycling rules, defined tolerances, deterministic behavior, in-place & out-of-place API.
**Restrictions:** No sparse support, no AD integration, no parallelization.
**Release Criterion:** Independently robust and usable.

#### Phase 2 – QP-Subproblem Reproduction

**Goal:** Exact QP → LDP → NNLS transformation as per the reference SLSQP.
**Includes:** Linearized constraints, Hessian + gradient construction, Householder/Cholesky steps, primal recovery.
**Validation:** Comparison with NLopt results.
**Optional Intermediate:** QP-Toolkit (if clearly independent).

#### Phase 3 – Complete SQP Loop

**Goal:** Algorithmically complete SLSQP.
**Includes:** BFGS update, merit function, line-search according to reference, active-set management, termination logic.
**Test Basis:** Hock-Schittkowski, degenerate constraints, ill-conditioned cases.
**Checkpoint:** Numerical equivalence achieved. Only here is SLSQP officially "reproduced."

#### Phase 4 – Integration

Integration of SciMLBase interface, `Optimization.jl` compatibility, documentation, benchmarks, and real-world problem examples. **No algorithmic intervention.**

#### Phase 5 – Targeted Modernization (Optional)

Only after secured reproduction:

* Improved AD support.
* Alternative QP backends.
* Performance tuning.
* Sparse matrix experiments.
* Diagnostic extensions.
**Modernization is kept separate and versioned.**

---

### 4. The "Not-To-Do" List (Protective Wall until Phase 3)

Until Phase 3 is completed, the following are **prohibited**:

* No AD dispatch in the core.
* No sparse matrix support.
* No multi-threading within the solver.
* No alternative line-search strategies.
* No alternative QP backends.
* No algorithmic "improvements."
* No SHGO-specific special paths.

**Only implementation improvements are allowed—no algorithmic changes.**

---

### 5. Risk Management

* **R1 – Architectural Euphoria:** Core first, modularization second.
* **R2 – Numerical Divergences:** Reference comparison at the iteration level.
* **R3 – Scope Explosion:** Feature freeze until Phase 3 is completed.
* **R4 – Maintenance Overload:** Intermediate products are only released if independently viable.

---

### 6. Success Criteria

The project is successful if:

1. A pure Julia SLSQP exists.
2. It corresponds numerically to NLopt/SciPy.
3. It is integrable into `Optimization.jl`.
4. At least one intermediate product is independently usable.
5. Modernization occurs consciously and controlled.

---

### 7. Strategic Essence

This project follows a clear order:
**Reproduction → Stabilization → Integration → Modularization → Modernization**

SLSQP is the end product. Intermediate products are intentionally crafted building blocks. Innovation begins only after secured equivalence.

**End of Phase 0.1.**


- Status: Completed.

### 0.2 – Numerical Constants & Tolerances Table
- Extract all hard-coded numerical values, tolerances, and thresholds.  
- Output: Table with columns: Parameter, Value, Source (with line/reference), Purpose, Sensitivity/Notes.

### Phase 0.2 – Numerical Constants & Tolerances Table  
**Version:** 1.3 (improved, categorized & consolidated)  
**Status:** Freeze-ready after forensics  

**Approach**  
- Primary sources: NLopt `slsqp.c` (main reference), SciPy `slsqp_opt.f` + Python wrapper, Kraft DFVLR-FB 88-28 (original intent).  
- Method: Manual extraction + cross-check with SciPy test suite & NLopt issues.  
- Improvements:  
  - Categorized into 3 blocks for clarity (core, termination, safety).  
  - Added missing "ghost constants" (curvature safeguard, activation threshold, and line-search factors).  
  - Added interaction matrix (small, 8 entries) to show dependencies.  
  - Noted SciPy vs NLopt divergences with "Reference Mode" suggestion (strict_nlopt / strict_scipy for testing).  
- Criteria: Only values influencing termination, feasibility, damping, or stability; Julia notes for adaptation (e.g. eps(T)).

### Forensic Guarantees

* Termination erfolgt **vor** QP-Build (wie in Kraft/NLopt).
* Null-Constraint-Fall degeneriert zu reinem BFGS.
* Kein künstlicher Dummy-Constraint.
* Iterationszähler startet bei 1.

### (mit deterministischer Singularitäts-Absicherung)

```julia
function solve_qp_via_nnls!(ws::SLSQPWorkspace)

    form_constraint_matrices!(ws)

    # --- Hessian factorization ---
    success, rank = factorize_hessian!(ws.B)

    if !success || rank < ws.n

```

```julia
function line_search!(ws, problem, options)

    merit0 = merit(ws)

    while true

        trial_x = ws.x .+ α .* ws.d

# 0.3.5 – Multiplier & Penalty Update

### (Maratos-Guard)

```julia
function update_multipliers_and_penalty!(ws)

    ws.lambda .= ws.lambda_qp

    lambda_max = norm(ws.lambda, Inf)

    if lambda_max > ws.rho
        ws.rho = ws.rho_factor * (lambda_max + 0.01)
    end
end
```

### Forensischer Zweck

* ρ dominiert Multiplikatoren.
* Verhindert Maratos-bedingte Step-Rejections.
* Deterministisch.

# 0.3.6 – Damped BFGS (Powell-Modifikation)

```julia

    s = ws.x_new .- ws.x
    y = ws.g_new .- ws.g

    sy = dot(s, y)

    if sy < ws.curvature_guard
        return   # skip update
    end

    sBs = dot(s, ws.B * s)

    if sy < ws.theta_lim * sBs

# Phase 0.3 – Status

**Final.**

- Status: Pending.

### 0.4 – Decision Logic & Exit Conditions
- Document all conditional branches, mode switches, exit codes, and reset conditions.  
- Output: Table or structured list (Condition → Action → Source → Meaning).  
- Status: Pending.

### 0.5 – Pathologies Mapping + First Draft of Architecture
- Map known failure modes, instabilities, and edge cases from literature and implementations.  
- Simultaneously produce the first rough architecture proposal (Proposal 1.0).  
- Output:  
  - Short pathologies table (Problem → Symptom → Original handling → Reference)  
  - Architecture Proposal 1.0 (very slim draft: product line, workspace sketch, principles)
  - 
## Phase 0.5 – First Draft of Architecture
**Architecture Proposal 1.0 (Preliminary Sketch)**  
**Status:** Preliminary first draft — created after Phase 0.1  
**Purpose:** Provide rough direction; to be validated and refined in Phase 1

### 1. Overall Structure (very high-level)

- Package name (provisional): **SLSQP.jl**  
- Primary goal: a faithful SLSQP solver  
- Planned independent modules (in order of development):  
  1. **CoreNNLS.jl** (Phase 1 – universally reusable)  
  2. **QPTransform.jl** (Phase 2)  
  3. **SLSQP.jl** (Phase 3 – integration of the above)

### 2. Central Architectural Idea (the only fixed element so far)

All modules will share a **mutable workspace pattern** to enable zero-allocation loops and type stability.

**Preliminary conceptual workspace outline (sketch only – not final):**

```julia
struct SLSQPWorkspace{T<:AbstractFloat}
    x::Vector{T}           # current point
    g::Vector{T}           # gradient
    c::Vector{T}           # constraints
    lambda::Vector{T}      # multipliers
    B::Matrix{T}           # Hessian approximation
    d::Vector{T}           # search direction
    # ... to be extended later
end
```

### 3. Core Guiding Principles (short & unchanged)

- Reproduction before innovation  
- In-place operations and type-generic design from the start  
- SciMLBase-compatible (`AbstractOptimizer`)  
- No new algorithms or features before Phase 4

**End of Phase 0.5.**
- Status: Architecture draft created (Phase 0.5 section already available).

### 0.6 – Go/No-Go & Phase 0 Closure
- Summarize all outputs from 0.1–0.5.  
- Evaluate readiness for Phase 1 (CoreNNLS).  
- Output: Final Phase 0 Report (Markdown/PDF) + explicit Go/No-Go decision.  
- Status: Pending – final checkpoint of Phase 0.

**Phase 0 Duration Estimate:** 2–4 weeks (pragmatic execution).  
**Success Criterion for Phase 0:**  
We have a complete, traceable foundation that allows faithful reproduction without guessing.
